Day-3:

Conditional statements: One condition will be carried out and it'll decide the next shot accordingly
synatx:

if condition:
   print("anything")
else:
   print("anything)

Multiple if statements: When multiple conditions need to be check rather than taken out one answer from the one condition

syntax:

if condition:
   do something
if condition:
   do something
if condition:
   do something

Alternative way of using round function:

a = {:.2f}.format(a)
print(a)

count() : To find the occurence of the letter in the string
lower() : To convert the uppercase to lower case of the string letters

example:

s= "Khushi"
s= s.lower()
output: khushi

s.count(k)
output: 1
