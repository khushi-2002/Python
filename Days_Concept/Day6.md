# Day 6:

## **Functions**

> def my_function():   
      print("Anything")

*Calling Function:*   myfunction()

Indentation is important to determine the scope availability

*out of the box:* Spaces preferred over tab for indentation purpose 
Even in Python3, spaces and tabs both togther are not allowed

## **While Loop**

>while comdition:  
      code..  
      increment or decrement..

Difference between While and for:

* For loop use when we want to iterate to each step
* While loop use when we want to iterate at any order
* While loop are more dangerous than for loop, because there could be a chances to go into a condition of infinite loop
